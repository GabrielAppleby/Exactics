# PLEASE DONT PUSH TO MASTER, MAKE A BRANCH

Aspects


Okay so right now this is trash. But it will be untrash. 

Remember: Don't change anything in the editor. Just do it all programmatically. 

To start just create an empty game object, drag the game manager and board manager script on to it, and press play.

Todo:

1.) Figure out where to load other floor tiles. Load is expensive. Can they somehow be static fields within the tilescript? I feel like there is a way to switch the color without switching the actual file, but I have not figured it out.

2.) Click on a unit that is on a square and have it highlight squares you can move to.

3.) Move from square to square.

4.) Refactor -- My organization of this stuff is currently shit.

5.) Start working on units...
